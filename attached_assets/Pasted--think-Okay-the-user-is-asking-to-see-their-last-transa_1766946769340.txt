Okay, the user is asking to see their last transaction with "this account," but they didn't specify which account. Since the default account is usually the main one, I should start by getting the default account details. Let me call the GetDefaultAccount function. Once I have the default account's ID, I can use it to fetch the recent transactions with GetAccountTransactionsByAccountId. I'll need to make sure to use the correct account ID from the default account response. If there's no default account, I'll have to ask the user to select an account from their list. But for now, let's proceed with the default account.

this is the response i see in the chat, can you remove the tags from the response, make the text surrounded by **<text>** actually bold, make the dark theme have the same fonts and a more similar theme to the light mode and I have also added a new file called models.json which details all the different types of responses you may receive from the webhook's contents.
